Sometimes we may need to create a video to use in the bug reports.

Usually it is easier to use the photo cam or something other, but if you need you may use the adb.

Quality is not perfect, it does a pause sometimes, so don't click fast.

It is just a simple perl script that is using the screencap command to save the screenshots one by one.
Using another command (on your choice, like in produce.sh) you may create a small video from these images.

If you are using the emulator - please modify and use screenshots.pl

If you are using the real device - please modify and use device_screenshots.sh
